# canadaBlog

Source of my furure travel blog :)

I will self host my blog (yes I know, you can have one for free, but hell - why not !)

The blog is powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.io/), a NodeJs library;

## Casper Randol

This is my fork of the default ghost theme [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper)
I remodelled it simply to fit my taste and what I wanted the blog to look and feel like.

For strucure and documentation, the Ghost team did an amazing job, just hop on the Casper page and the [official documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/docs)
